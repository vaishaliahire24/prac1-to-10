    <p><b>
    The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), also known as the common peafowl or blue peafowl,
    is a peafowl species native to the Indian subcontinent. While it originated in the Indian subcontinent, it
    has since been introduced to many other parts of the world. Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks,
    and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, although both sexes are often referred to colloquially as
    a "peacock". </b></p>

    <p>The Indian peafowl displays a marked form of sexual dimorphism. The brightly coloured male has a blue
    coloured head with a fan-shaped crest and is best known for their long train. The train is made up of elongated
    upper-tail covert feathers with colourful eyespots. These stiff feathers are raised into a fan and quivered 
    in a display during courtship.</p>
